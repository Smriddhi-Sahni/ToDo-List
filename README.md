## Working
I have used Bootstrap & jQuery and made a responsive and dynamic ToDo List.

Type the task in the space provided, click enter or the add button, the task will be added. On clicking on the task it will be striked off wich means it is completed. 
Resest will clear the contents if any in the space for writing a new task.
Sort will sort the tasks in the list by order of when they were added and the striked off tasks will be pushed to the end of the list.
Clean-up will delete the striked off tasks.
